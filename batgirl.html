                <h3 class="strategy">The Strategist</h3>
                <p class="playboy">Batgirl has highly advanced detective skills compared to the rest of the team and uses this remarkably well. Batgirl eventually became someone behind the scenes and less on the forefront when she was shot by the Joker and became paralyzed. Not wanting to be apart, she worked alongside everyone from the Batcave and gave great insight into helping stop the villains in Gotham City.</p>
